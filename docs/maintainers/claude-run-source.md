# Claude Code run-source contract

This document records the read-only local observation contract verified against
the installed Claude Code CLI `2.1.289` on 2026-10-04.

The local evidence commands were `claude --version`, `claude --help`,
`claude agents --help`, and `claude agents --json --all`; the latter was used
only to read the catalog. The primary behavior references are
[Commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/commands),
[Routines](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines), and
[Subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents).

## Producers

`claude agents --json --all` is the installed CLI session catalog. Its observed
JSON records contain `id`, `cwd`, `kind`, `name`, `sessionId`, `startedAt`, and
`state` for background agents, plus `pid` and `status` for interactive sessions.
The command is read-only and is the authoritative producer for the session
catalog, but it does not expose child relationships or wake times.

Claude Code also writes local background-job records at
`~/.claude/jobs/<job-id>/state.json`. `internal/surface/surfaces/claude_run_source.go`
reads those files without invoking Claude Code. The source exposes only fields
observed in that producer:

- `runType` is the exact `template` value, such as `bg`.
- `providerState` is the exact `state` value, such as `working`, `blocked`,
  `done`, `failed`, or `stopped`.
- `sessionId` and `resumeSessionId` are copied exactly.
- `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are parsed only as RFC3339 timestamps.

The job record's `children` array is not used for session relationship
observation. Its observed member was an artifact descriptor (`kind: frame`),
not a Claude agent identity.

Subagent relationships use a separate local producer:
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<parent-session-id>/subagents/agent-<agent-id>.jsonl`.
`ObserveClaudeSubagentLinks` derives the parent session and agent ID from that
path, then requires a JSONL record with matching exact `sessionId` and
`agentId`. This yields a validated parent-session -> local-agent link without
deriving state from transcript content.

## Deliberately unavailable

The verified job records contain no typed `waiting`, `wakeAt`, cron, or
schedule fields. Timeline records at `~/.claude/jobs/<job-id>/timeline.jsonl`
contain only `at`, `state`, `detail`, and `text`. Agenthail therefore does not
infer waiting from `blocked`, prose, or timestamps, and it does not invent a
wake time.

The installed CLI help exposes `--bg` and `claude agents --json --all`, but not
`/loop` or `/schedule`: those are interactive skills, not session-catalog
fields. The primary Claude Code docs describe `/loop` as repeating a prompt
while a session stays open and `/schedule` as managing cloud routines. Neither
document defines a local `~/.claude/jobs` schema that Agenthail can consume.

No cancellation or scheduling action is implemented here. Existing Claude
targets are never messaged, stopped, resumed, or otherwise mutated.

## Shared-surface follow-up

The observation is intentionally not wired into `internal/surface/surface.go`
or the daemon session projection in this change. A future integration must add
typed optional fields to the shared session contract and prove the complete
producer -> projection -> CLI/API/native consumer path before exposing them.
